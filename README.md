# Lorem-Ipsum

Lorem Ipsum Library (LIL) is a web application designed to allow users to browse books and see their details and reviews available querying the Google Book API.
LIL's users are also able to add specific books to their "favourites" and to rate them.
The user interface has been implemented using HTML and Sass, while Javascript has been used to animate the page and to manage the submission of the information to the server-side. 
PHP has been used to implement the back-end and MySQL has been chosen for the data storage.
